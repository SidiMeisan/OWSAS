# OWSAS
Open Web Student Application System base on Laravel

The Student Application System (SAS) is an information system that will allow school leavers to view the programmes available at different universities and submit applications to join the programmes easily. Each applicant will record their qualifications to be used repeatedly for the applications. University administrators will be able to record different types of qualifications and match equivalent qualifications. The SAS Admin will be responsible for recording the various types of qualifications and register new universities and the respective university administrators.
